Welcome to the AGSA-Agronomy Agronomic Calculator Example repository! This repository was created during our workshop: [Boost Research Collaboration using Version Control Systems](https://agsa-ksu.github.io/vcs-workshop/). The aim of this project is to create a simple module with functions that are useful for agronomy and research.

During the workshop, participants were encouraged to fork this repository and contribute to the project to discover the potential of VCS for peer collaborations. We are thrilled to announce that we received contributions from most of the participants!
